# Order to Delivery Workflow (SAP SD–Inspired)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how I think about customer order management and delivery coordination in ERP-driven environments, inspired by SAP SD Order-to-Cash processes.

The focus is not on SAP configuration, but on operational decision-making, availability checks, and customer communication.

## Workflow
Customer Order  
→ Order Validation (Quantity / Date / Data)  
→ Availability Check (ATP logic)  
→ Schedule Confirmation  
→ Delivery Tracking  
→ Customer Feedback & Closure

## Key Operational Considerations
- Confirm only realistic delivery dates
- Identify availability constraints early
- Escalate implausible requests with data
- Communicate proactively with customers

## Tools & Concepts
- ERP process thinking
- SAP SD Order-to-Cash (conceptual)
- Availability Check (ATP)
- On-Time Delivery (OTD)
- Process documentation

## Why This Matters
Clear order-to-delivery workflows reduce delivery failures, customer escalations, and last-minute firefighting.
